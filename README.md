## Introduction

Have you ever wanted to explore a lengthy but practical piece of code? This repository provides just that! The `random_long_code.py` file contains a Python script that generates random data, performs data preprocessing, trains a logistic regression model, and evaluates its accuracy.

## Code Overview

The script does the following:

- Imports necessary libraries including NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn.
- Generates random data for demonstration purposes.
- Splits the data into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function.
- Initializes a logistic regression model and trains it on the training data.
- Makes predictions on the testing data and calculates the accuracy of the model.
